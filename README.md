<b>Executive Summary</b>

COVID-19 has been a reality of life for what feels like years, but is in actuality around 9 months. At this point, we are starting to get a grasp on the widespread consequences and surreptitious effects of a pandemic-caused quarantine. Aside from the obvious ones, such as increases in depression and anxiety, a variety of sociologic phenomenon have made themselves known in the elapsed months. The phenomenon that I wish to inspect, using data provided by the Nashville Police Department and TN.gov, is the increase in perceived driver incidents in the Nashville Area.

<b>Motivation</b>

Since the advent of COVID-19, I feel like there have been noticeably more times where I have been driving home from work at midnight, and some drunk driver either nearly runs me off the road or comes within a hair of slamming into my car when I’m driving up Ellington. This leads me to believe that for whatever reason, quarantine has contributed to a detriment in driver competency, be it due to increased alcohol consumption or less ‘practice’ time spent driving.  My MVP will be as follows:

<b>Data Questions</b>

Present the average metrics for traffic incidents over the last five years before COVID (2014-2019) by incident type in the Nashville area
What was the mean/median rate of DUI’s and traffic incidents by month?
During what months of the year did these metrics rise/fall?
Compare these gathered and prepared metrics to current metrics 
Use either Tableau Story or Powerpoint Presentation with linking SQL queries or Python code
POSSIBLE ANCILLARY ANALYSIS: heat map of highest concentrations for each metric?

<b>Minimally Viable Products</b>

Complete outside research and presentation giving possible explanations for the resulting differences or maintenance of these figures


<b>Data Sources</b>

Dataset from the Nashville Police Department regarding traffic incidents, reaching back to before the beginning of our study.

Dataset from TN.gov showing the cases (total, active, recovered), tests, hospitalizations, and deaths by day for each county in Tennessee

Dataset from Nashville Police Department only available upon request (directly given .xlsx)

<b>Known Issues and Challenges</b>

Current metrics will need be calculated/updated as close to the presentation as possible.
Will require cleaning of incident description to enable grouping, using Tableau Prep, Excel, or Python
Will need to segment several years worth of data sets using SQL or Python
Will need to remove any PII columns in the data set
